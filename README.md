This is my Thoughts for Gary Java app remade using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

It combines random images of Gary Busey with random quotes from Friedrich Nietzche.  I think the appeal is obvious.

All images and quotes were taken from the internet without permission, and this site is intended for humorous purposes only.
