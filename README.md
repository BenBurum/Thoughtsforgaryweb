# Thoughtsforgaryweb
This is my Thoughts for Gary Java app remade using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  When it's ready I'll put it live at www.thoughtsforgary.com

It combines random images of Gary Busey with random quotes from Friedrich Nietzche.  I think the appeal is obvious.

All images and quotes were taken from the internet without permission, and this site is intended for humorous purposes only.
